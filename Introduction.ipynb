    "I'm going to be brutally honest the fifa.csv file literally took me by surprise. I found it a positive challenge trying to figure out how to resolve the errors I was getting. I even turned to Facebook to ask in the python group i'm part of for some help. I did get some help but the issues I was experiencing weren't resovled. I then came up with a solution which worked. And other solutions were given to me by Asif Iqbal one of the members of the group. I also turned to my friends Aravind Subramaniam and Simranpal Kohil. Simranpal figured out my problem. It was so simple the error but I was not expecting nor looking for it. I was expecting the csv file to be cleaned because this is an introduction to python the course I undertook at Datacamp. But it just cause to show that one should always be prepared for the unexpected. It was a fun course and I learned alot. So I created this notebook as a reminder that yes Ana you did it. Like last year I was useless I couldn't understand what on earth I was getting myself into but now i'm getting more confidence as I keep progressing in this field. I hope whoever reads this might find it somewhat useful. "
